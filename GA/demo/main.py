# that bitstring
# WHY bitstring to numbers is IMPORTANTðŸš¨
# A: Because we need the real or int number 
#    to calculate objective function
#
# Powerful decoder for N number of variable inside a cromosome
# bounds:(array[array]) is holding upper and lower bounds of each variable
# n_bits:(int) is the length of bits per variable, equal for all variable
# bitstring:(array) is your cromosome where you put all the variables sequencially in bit from
#
# guessing you have sequencially put variables in bounds and bitstring
# but maybe you can ignore this logic
# but what you will get in decoded array list is according to your bound sequence
def decode(bounds, n_bits, bitstring):
    decoded = list() # all decoded value will be stored here

    largest = 2 ** n_bits # the possible largest value of this given bit size/variable/index

    for i in range(len(bounds)): # `bounds` actually means number of variable in this bitstring/cromosome

        # extract the substring
        start, end = i * n_bits, (i * n_bits) + n_bits
        # guess n_bits = 10

        # 10, 20
        # 20, 30
        # 30, 40
        # .., ..
        # actually we are spliting cromosome to identify the index variable
        # and then decode it to get what is the number denoting that string

        # we are taking that portion of cromosome
        # we are cutting the bitstring equally here!!

        # 2 denotes binary conversion
        integer = int(chars, 2) # convert binary to int;
